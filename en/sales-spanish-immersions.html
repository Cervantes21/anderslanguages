              <p>1.7. Accommodation the night before the immersion start and/or the night after ending the program can be included or not, depending on the program. Make sure to check your final price proposal for details. </p>
              <p>1.8. No classes are given during official holidays in the country where your immersion is offered. Nevertheless, we will reschedule these lost days during your stay, so you won't lose classes you've paid for. For an overview of local holidays, please contact us. </p>
              <p>1.9. We guarantee that we will do all we can to help the client to achieve his or her learning objectives.

              <h2>2. REFUNDS & RESCHEDULING: </h2>
              <br>
              <h5>Refunds are NOT possible unless ANDERS LANGUAGES cancels an immersion or if the money-back guarantee applies. </h5>
              <h5>Cancellations and rescheduling requests are subject to the policies outlined below. Make sure to READ them ALL. </h5>
              <h5>We recommend purchasing travel insurance to cover any unexpected situation. If you want to be fully covered, make sure to include CFAR (Cancel For Any Reason) coverage. </h5>
              <br>
              <p>2.1. Rescheduling</p>
              <p>2.2.1. Programs NOT INCLUDING the Luxury Experience</p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made up to 61 days prior to the course-start date: no administrative fee is due. </p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made between 60 and 31 days prior to the course-start date: an administrative fee equivalent to 25% of the program’s total cost applies. </p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made between 30 and 4 days prior to the course-start date: an administrative fee equivalent to 50% of the program’s total cost applies. </p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made between 3 days or less prior to the course-start date: not accepted. </p>
              <p>2.2.2. Programs INCLUDING the Luxury Experience</p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made up to 61 days prior to the course-start date: an administrative fee equivalent to 25% of the program’s total cost applies. </p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made between 60 and 31 days prior to the course-start date: an administrative fee equivalent to 50% of the program’s total cost applies. </p>
              <p>- Rescheduling requests made between 30 days or less prior to the course-start date: not accepted. </p>
              <p>2.2. Requests to reschedule are only accepted by email. </p>
              <p>2.3. You can transfer your booking from Mexico to Spain or from Spain to Mexico without changing the program details. In case you choose a more expensive location, you will be required to pay the price difference. If a less expensive location is chosen, you will still need to cover the full cost of the original program. However, the difference will be converted into a credit. Locations changes are subject to availability. </p>
              <p>2.4. In no case will money be refunded once the course has started (except for the money back guarantee). </p>
              <p>2.5. Unconditional, money back guarantee. We know our business and how to maintain satisfied clients. If you aren't satisfied, however, just tell us during the first day of the training and we will return your money. To claim the money-back guarantee, you need to have completed the first day of your immersion. </p>
              <p>2.6. When rescheduling, please take the following into account: </p>
              <p>- When you want to reschedule your immersion, you can only do so 30 days before the new starting day. </p>
              <p>- We cannot guarantee openings: rescheduling is subject to availability. </p>
              <p>- Although we try to respect any room upgrade as booked originally, the room upgrade is not guaranteed when rescheduling, even if you paid for it. </p>
              <p>- You have 12 months after the original starting day to reschedule. </p>
              <p>- Each booking can be rescheduled only once. </p>
              <p>- If there has been a fee increase by the time you rebook, you will be required to pay the balance due (if applicable) plus the difference between the original and new fees. </p>
              <p>2.7. In the event ANDERS LANGUAGES cancels an immersion, the client will receive a full refund. The client won’t be able to claim other expenses. </p>
              <p>2.8. Under no circumstances will we offer refunds for immersions cancelled due to force majeure: pandemics, acts of nature or similar events. However, we will offer the possibility to reschedule your immersion. </p>
              <p>2.9. Refunds are NOT possible. We recommend purchasing travel insurance to cover any unexpected situation. If you want to be fully covered, make sure to include CFAR (Cancel For Any Reason) coverage. Of course, we will work with you and your insurance company to recover your deposit. If your claim for a deposit is successful, a new booking will require a new deposit. </p>
              <p>2.10. Credits. In case you want to use a credit for a booking, you can only book 30 days before the intended starting day. The credit will be applied for an amount not exceeding 50% of the total cost of a new booking. This does not apply for credits obtained through online classes. Other conditions may apply, if outlined in the price proposal. </p>
              <p>2.11. Administrative fees, if applicable, will be added to your final bill</p>

              <p>4.14. The name ANDERS LANGUAGES is a registered trademark. All the ANDERS LANGUAGES course materials, documents and audios are the results of our work and our expertise. We exercise all our intellectual property rights over them fully and without reservation. All rights are reserved for all our products, which may in no case be reproduced, even partially, by any means, nor be rented, sold, lent or exploited in any other way. </p>

              <p>4.18. Pick up service. Unexpected traffic or issues out of our control can result in our driver being late for your pick-up. If that happens, we will inform you via WhatsApp and offer you an alternative. However, rest assured we do everything reasonable to avoid this kind of circumstances. Maximum two passengers. 4 pieces of luggage: 2 pieces with a maximum weight of 32 kg / 70 pounds and maximum size of 158 cm / 62 inches (L+W+H) plus 2 pieces with a maximum weight of 10 kg / 22 pounds and maximum size of 118 cm / 47 inches (L+W+H) </p>
              <p>4.19. Drop-off service. We will recommend a departure time based on the time you need to get to your destination. In case you decide to depart later than the recommended time, we can’t be held responsible in case of a late arrival at your destination.

              <p>4.20. Welcome service. The service ends at 10 pm. If you arrive at the immersion residence after 7 pm because of traffic or a cancelled, delayed or late flight, the number of hours offered will be reduced. The service will be cancelled if you arrive at the immersion residence after 10:00 pm. In these cases, you cannot request any refund or compensation. If you book a flight scheduled to arrive in the evening, we recommend not using our welcome service or canceling the welcome service at the latest 72 hours before arrival to receive a refund or extra hours of class. </p>
              <p>4.21. It’s the client’s responsibility to provide us with all arrival (or pick-up) details at the latest 6 natural days before the scheduled arrival day. If not, the meet-and-greet service will be cancelled with no right to a refund. </p>
              <p>4.22. The Experiences. Because of reasons beyond of our control, such as weather conditions or availability of providers, some of the activities may not be available during your stay: in that case, you can choose a similar activity at no additional cost. </p>
              <p>4.23. In case we can't accommodate you at the immersion residence, we reserve the right to accommodate you in a hotel with comfort levels similar to those at the immersion residence. Ground transportation between the hotel and the immersion residence will be at our expense. </p>
              <p>4.24. Price proposals are subject to change without notice unless you have made a down payment. </p>
              <p>4.25. Credit card fees or banking fees are not refundable. </p>
              <p>4.26. Payments for on-site programs cannot be transferred to online programs. Missed on-site classes cannot be offered online. </p>
              <p>4.27. If you would like to start your program on different days from the ones described in our programs, we may not be able to offer accommodations for the arrival or departure day. If that’s the case, you will need to book a hotel nearby. We will be pleased to advice. </p>
              <p>4.28. Programs INCLUDING the Luxury Experience: in case the mansion is not available for reasons beyond our control, we reserve the right to organize the program at our immersion residence. In that case the price difference between the Luxury program and a similar program at the ANDERS LANGUAGES immersion residence will be refunded. </p>
              <p>4.29. Meals. We serve home-made meals, prepared by our cook using local recipes and ingredients. While most of our guests enjoy the food we serve, it’s important to be aware of the fact that we do not offer an a-la-carte menu and that what we serve might be different from what you are used to. </p>
              <p>Our cook will be pleased to adapt the menu for guests with diet restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten free…) as far as it does not change the serving of our other guests. For example, our cook can replace pork by chicken or beef… For those not eating meat, we can serve fish or/add more (and different) vegetables. While breakfast always includes dairy products, it also includes fresh fruit, marmalades, honey, cereals among other things. </p>
              <p>In case you follow a very strict diet, we recommend to bring your own ingredients and/or food complements as we won’t be able to accommodate all diet restrictions. You can also opt for our Luxury Experience, offering a-la-carte menus with no restrictions. </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, we can currently not honor requests for halal and kosher food. </p>
              <p>Dinner is only served for programs including the Dinner & Evening Activity complement. If you don’t include this complement, you can make yourself dinner in our kitchen. Restaurants and home delivery are also available. </p>
